### Project overview
Humans drive car mainly by eyes, the visual ability. Not only the object classification, but also the tracking of many objects. So the object detection, one of the AI technologies, is the most suitable technology for self driving car system.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the Waymo Open Dataset
* Explore and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images by animaition

### Set up
Because I'm using the classroom workspace with the necessary libraries and data already available, thanks Udacity, there's no need to set up development environment. Just git clone my repository, then run it!

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis

* The size of training set is ?
* The size of the validation set is ?
* The size of test set is ?
* The shape of an image is width 640px, height 640px, 3 color channels.
* The distribution of classes is: vehicle - 77.6%, pedestrian - 21.8%, cyclist - 0.6%

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set, 10 images randomly.

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
