### Project overview
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self driving car systems?

### Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis

* The size of training set is ?
* The size of the validation set is ?
* The size of test set is ?
* The shape of a traffic sign image is ?
* The number of unique classes in the data set is ?

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set.

And the distribution of classes 

#### Cross validation
This section should detail the cross validation strategy and justify your approach.

### Training
#### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should includes training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

#### Improve on the reference
This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
